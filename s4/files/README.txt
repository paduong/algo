19/1/2018 new graphs for Euler:
"house.gra" # the house from tutorial
"notEuler.gra" # the house modified -> not eulerian
4 eulerian graphs :
"eulerianXX.gra" # XX: graph order

5/12/2017 new graphs:
a "tree": "files/graph_tree.gra"
two "not trees": "files/graph_not_tree1.gra" "files/graph_not_tree2.gra"

Graphs from tuto (S3):

"files/digraph1.gra" # digraph G1
"files/graph2.gra" # graph G2
"files//digraph_distance.gra" # digraph for Distance from start)
(-1 to each vertex number)

Extra graphs:

"files/digraph800.gra"        # digraph n = 803, p = 64240
"files/digraph800acyclic.gra" # acyclic digraph n = 803, p = 32262
